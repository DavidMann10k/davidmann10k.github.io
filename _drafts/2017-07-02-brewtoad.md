[Brewtoad.com](https://www.brewtoad.com/) is a online application that I had the
pleasure of working on during my employment at Ackmann & Dickenson.
It's one of the largest and most recognizable online applications for
homebrewing beer recipes.

I have many recipes and it's still my go to tool for recipe formulation.

My role on the Brewtoad team was as a back-end engineer. I created new features using Ruby on Rails, javascript, knockout.js, Postgresql. I handled deployments as well as maintainance on Rackspace servers.

There were many features I was involved in creating. We developed an ecommerce system for ordering ingredients.

#### Homebrew Con

For several years running I had the pleasure of representing Brewtoad at Homebrew Con. It was a lot of fun. As a homebrewer and a developer I was perfectly suited to answer questions about how to use the application. Meeting the users and fans of Brewtoad was always a good time.
