Crosswired is the game I and my team built for the 2018 Global Game Jam. It's a virtual reality game about operating a space age switchboard. The player finds themself in a rusty can suspended in space. The player can then pull plugs out of the switchboard and match them, by color, to sockets of the same color. As the player matches more and more calls the cabling becomes more and more messy, creating a fun sort of Twister-style challenge. There is a soundscape built up around the player creating a nice ambience and if the player holds a plug up near their ear they will hear the voices of callers coming through the wires.

The team:

- Ashley Nicole
- Brock Thompson
- Bryan Schumann
- Cody Sass
- David Mann
- Emma Martin
- Jake Annis
- Kayla Techmeier
- Lowell Rice
- Martha Megarry
- Nathan Yourchuck
