Crosswired is a VR game my team built for the 2018 Global Game Jam. The player finds themself in a rusty can suspended in space. The game is played by pulling plugs off the switchboard panels and connecting them to matching color sockets. There is a soundscape built up around the player creating a nice ambience and if the player holds a plug up near their ear they will hear the voices of callers coming through the wires.

As the player matches more and more calls the cabling becomes more and more messy, creating a fun sort of twister-style challenge.
