[Brewtoad.com](https://www.brewtoad.com/) is a online application that I had the
pleasure of working on for Ackmann & Dickenson.
It's one of the largest and most recognizable online applications for
homebrewing beer recipes.

I have many recipes there and it's still my go to tool for recipe formulation.

#### My Role
My role on the Brewtoad team was as a back-end engineer. I built a variety of features with **Ruby on Rails**, **javascript**, **knockout.js**, **Postgresql**. I also handled deployments as well as maintainance on Rackspace servers.

#### Homebrew Con

For several years running I had the pleasure of representing Brewtoad at Homebrew Con. It was a lot of fun. As a homebrewer and a developer I was perfectly suited to answer questions about how to use the application. Meeting the users and fans of Brewtoad was always a good time.
