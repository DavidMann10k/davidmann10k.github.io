This is a rough brainstorm for a 60% keyboard made for hacking code. Blue shift keys coorespond to blue legend marks. Bronze FN key cooresponds to bronze legend marks.

## Design Goals:
* #### 60% keyboard good for hacking code.
  * Writing code makes heavy use of symbols and arrow keys. I want a small board designed for hacking code.
* #### Move symbols closer to the home-row.
  * Moving symbol keys closer to the center of the board will mean spending less time resetting my hands to home-row position.
* #### Top level arrow keys
  * I use arrows all the time when coding, but many 60% boards omit them. So compromises were made to keep them on the top level.
* #### Reduce reaching
  * This board is 13.25 horizontal units wide and has a maximum of 13 keys per row. This means less reaching to find keys, which can be especially challenging in combination with holding modifier keys.
* #### Do something more useful with caps lock key
  * Caps lock is worthless and it sits on some valuable real-estate. I wanted to use it for something that more commonly used in hacking code and that's definitely the apostophe.
